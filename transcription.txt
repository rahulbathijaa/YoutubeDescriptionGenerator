 Transcription(text="Tootsie Rolls seem simple enough, that piece of gooey chocolate wrapped up in a perfect little bite. But believe it or not, these tasty treats saved the lives of U.S. Marines in the Korean War. So good. In 1950, at the North Korean Chosin Reservoir, U.S. Marine troops were engaged in battle. The Marines were running out of ammunition and called for an airdrop of 60 millimeter mortar rounds. Codename for these bullets, Tootsie Roll. When the supplies fell from the sky, troops were surprised to find boxes filled with the actual candies. Where are the bullets? This fluke turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Freezing cold temperatures had cracked vehicle fuel lines, leaving troops stranded. And although the candies were frozen, they softened easily in the mouths of servicemen. So good. Marines quickly realized they could melt the candies down to a putty and seal the broken pipes. Good as new. When the chocolate refroze, they were able to drive to safety in their newly functional vehicles. The Marines who successfully escaped the reservoir admit that Tootsie Rolls had a big hand in their survival and they call themselves the Chosen Few. I'd call that a pretty sweet victory.")
